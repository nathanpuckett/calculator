# Calculator
This is a basic calculator created as part of the Javascript unit of The Odin Project. It demonstrates event listeners for GUI integration, DOM manipulation for user feedback, & thorough logic to make sure everything works predictably. You can view and use the calulator [here](https://nathanpuckett.github.io/calculator/). Just don't try to divide by zero!
